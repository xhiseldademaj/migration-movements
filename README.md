# Why_Do_Populations_Move

# GENERAL FRAMEWORK

From ancient times, human history has been marked by mass migration events, often triggered by economic difficulties and poverty, by armed conflict, or political and social instabilities. ”In the first decades of our millennium the combined effect of globalization and geopolitical issues has triggered notable migration trends across a turbulent global socioeconomic landscape” (Curry et al. 2019). But what are the main reasons of this mass-migration phenomenon? 
In this work we examine some stylized facts represented by the migrant-routes which depart from north Africa with the aim of reaching final destination countries. During their journey migrants arrive in the hotspots of the European coasts. The hotspots are the centres of first reception of people arriving in Europe by land or by sea without a regular residence permit. ”The hotspot approach was introduced by the European Commission in the European Agenda on Migration in April 2015, at the height of the migration crisis, as a means of providing emergency assistance to frontline Member States that were faced with the arrival of disproportionate numbers of migrants” (European Parliament 2018). According to European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the states who play a crucial role in the first welcome policies are mainly Greece and Italy where indeed the hotspots are located. 
In this work we study the migrants’ pathways from their home countries to final destination countries, as well as the conditions and activities that evolve during the migration process.
