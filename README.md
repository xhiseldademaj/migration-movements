# Why_Do_Populations_Move

# GENERAL FRAMEWORK

From ancient times, human history has been marked by mass migration events, often triggered by economic difficulties and poverty, by armed conflict, or political and social instabilities. ”In the first decades of our millennium the combined effect of globalization and geopolitical issues has triggered notable migration trends across a turbulent global socioeconomic landscape” (Curry et al. 2019). But what are the main reasons of this mass-migration phenomenon? 
In this work we examine some stylized facts represented by the migrant-routes which depart from north Africa with the aim of reaching final destination countries. During their journey migrants arrive in the hotspots of the European coasts. The hotspots are the centres of first reception of people arriving in Europe by land or by sea without a regular residence permit. ”The hotspot approach was introduced by the European Commission in the European Agenda on Migration in April 2015, at the height of the migration crisis, as a means of providing emergency assistance to frontline Member States that were faced with the arrival of disproportionate numbers of migrants” (European Parliament 2018). According to European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the states who play a crucial role in the first welcome policies are mainly Greece and Italy where indeed the hotspots are located. 
In this work we study the migrants’ pathways from their home countries to final destination countries, as well as the conditions and activities that evolve during the migration process.

# HOW THE MODEL WORKS?

# Entities and variables of interest

For sake of simplicity, we assume that the group of migrants we consider is made up of three different ethnic groups represented by three different colors assigned to the agents. We assume that migrants all depart from the same initial-patch, which can be assumed to be Tripoli, the Lybian port located in north Africa. Before reaching the final destination countries, migrants pass through the hotspot zones which constitute a provisional arrival and first reception area. To reach these areas they engage a journey, which is often by sea. But the arrival in the first reception areas is not always easy and linear to predict, since it is subject to many factors. we take into consideration the
stochasticity of the journey process, and we introduce three probabilities according to which the migrants reach one of the three hotspots. More specifically, we assume that q1 represents the migrants arrival in Italy, q2 their arrival in Greece and q3 the arrival in Turkey. Here the probabilities q1, q2 and q3 are assumed to be as indicators of internal welcome policies adopted by the host countries.

We also assume migrants to be rational agents who aim to maximize a determined objective function and that, before leaving their home countries, migrants have a set of links with some agents located in the destination countries. The link represents the migrant’s connection with his community in the country of final destination and they are supposed to guide the choice of the final destination country.

We rely now on the ODD protocol in order to describe the building process of our model.
